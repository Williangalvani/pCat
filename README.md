# pCat
Process Control Analysis Tool

This project is part of a mandatory internship for my graduation in Control and Automation Engineering at Federal University of Santa Catarina.

pCat will be a graphic interface that will allow better analysis and visualization of some plots generated by matlab or octave. These plots mostly will represent simulation of control processes. But since the program is open source, it can be repurposed by the the community in later versions.

The program basicaly loads a .mat file in a qt generated GUI where the user will be allowed to choose which variables to plot and how to plot it in a very user friendly environment. For that we will use pyside 2 a QT for python package developed by QT. Also we will use some specific libraries such as numpy and  scipy in order to deal with the data analysis.h

So far the project is on its very early stages, but since it is a part of a mandatory internship, the idea is to finish the most basic features  by the end of november.
